This page will guide you through the steps needed to install SWICD on your Steam Deck

## How to install
1. Download and install [ViGEm Bus driver](https://github.com/ViGEm/ViGEmBus/releases)
2. Download and install [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable Package](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)*
3. Download and install [Steam Windows Controller Driver(SWICD)](https://github.com/mKenfenheuer/steam-deck-windows-usermode-driver/releases)
4. If Steam is installed, make sure it is closed. Steam doesnt like us messing with their controller.
5. Run the .exe file inside the zip, or install the whole solution via the .msi
6. [Configure your controller via the GUI](https://github.com/mKenfenheuer/steam-deck-windows-usermode-driver/wiki/Profiles)
7. Have fun!

*may not be necessary if you have previously installed a game or other program that installed it for you.  Needed if you are installing SWICD on a fresh installation of Windows.
